- A sitemap is a blueprint of your website that help search engines find, crawl and index all of your website’s content. Sitemaps also tell search engines which pages on your site are most important.
- To better understand how the result might look, we decided to share Miro’s site map and also an example of how it might look like if we bloated the number of pages and didn’t think through the structure. You can use these as an example when you are creating a map for your product’s website.

### Figjam Content

- I used diferent colours and shapes to show diffrence between levels of pages/categries
- I used same colour and shapes for one level so i can identify the flow
- I used different colour for cotent-type to identify that which one is product and which one is post
