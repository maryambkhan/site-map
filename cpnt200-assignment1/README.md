## Code Journal

 - I looked at bunch of templates and collected ideas.
 - This is one of them and i actualy learn the purpose and better way to site a map from this site.
 - [miro](https://miro.com/blog/how-to-create-a-sitemap/)
 - This was realy good learning process i can viualize a site with maping 
  it.

### Figjam Content

- I used diferent colours and shapes to show diffrence between levels of pages/categries
- I used same colour and shapes for one level so i can identify the flow
- I used different colour for cotent-type to identify that which one is product and which one is post

### Basic Info

- [Aldo Shoes](https://www.aldoshoes.com/ca/en)

- I decided to go with `Aldo` website
- It was very well orgnaized site i realy liked it
- The have well orgnized categries and levels
- This site only had `Card, Posts, and article` so much repetation
- One more thing there login  and sign up  i did not like it
- I would like to change it and make it more like button

### Personal Reflection 

- I learned how to map out a site for a client
- I learnend how the url works
- Most importent thing i learned is how to create a component in storyblok
- And what fields i am going to need to create a card or a post

### Ideas for Card:

- To create card component i need to create fields:
    -  Title
    -  Image
    -  Price
    -  CTA 
    -  Ratings
    -  Icon
    -  Size available
    -  Price
